### Hello everyone ðŸ‘‹

#### A brief intro :P

- A Full Stack dev in love with the JavaScript ecosystem who enjoys understanding and implementing service in the Cloud, currently working @ Prisma.

- ðŸ”­ I have experience with technologies like React, Node and with creating and deploying applications on AWS hands-on with various services like ECS, Lambda, SQS, S3 and Cloudfront to name a few.

- GraphQL and TypeScript have blown me away and the Developer Experience that they provide makes me never wanna go back to REST and JS :D

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Rust and the experience is truly amazing. I'm also trying my hands at Kubernetes as an experience to know how is it like orchestrating services apart from ECS.

#### Hobbies âš¡

- I love playing the ðŸŽ¸ and I'm up for a _jamming session_ as well :D. I also play snooker and follow it closely.

- ðŸ“š I like reading books in my spare time so do send me suggestions of your favourites :)

- Lastly, Math always intrigues me and it amazes me how the world works around the rules of Mathematics.
