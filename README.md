### Hello everyone ðŸ‘‹

#### A brief intro :P

- A Full Stack Cloud Native Engineer in love with the JavaScript ecosystem who enjoys understanding and implementing services on the Cloud, currently working @ Prisma.

- ðŸ”­ I have experience with technologies like React, Node, Python, and with creating and deploying applications on AWS hands-on with various services like ECS, Lambda, SQS, S3 and Cloudfront to name a few.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently implementing CLIs and APIs Rust and the experience is truly amazing. I'm also trying my hands at Kubernetes as an experience to know how is it like orchestrating services apart from ECS.

#### Hobbies âš¡

- I love playing the ðŸŽ¸ and I'm up for a _jamming session_ as well :D. I also play snooker and follow it closely.

- ðŸ“š I like reading books in my spare time so do send me suggestions of your favourites :)

- Lastly, Math always intrigues me and it amazes me how the world works around the rules of Mathematics.
